## Conclusion
Survey metadata and notes.
1. General
   - The results of this study are based on 65,437 answers from 185 countries.
   - A total of 48,019 replies were utilized to generate the wage data.
   - Due to the extra questions this year, we anticipated that qualifying replies to the survey would take an average of over 21 minutes to complete.
   - On June 11, 2024, wages were translated from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate.
   - In the replies we retained for study, qualifiers included an attention check question, a consent question, and the question "Which of the following options best describes you today?" Not utilized were almost 20K replies.
   - Between May 19, 2024, and June 20, 2024, the survey was conducted.
   - The main routes used to find respondents were those that belonged to Stack Overflow. Site message, blog entries, email and newsletter subscribers, banner advertisements, and social media posts were the primary sources of responses. Highly-engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey during the collecting promotion because respondents were recruited in this manner.
   - This year, rather of showing the overall frequency of replies, some questions with multiple choice answers will now be shown as a proportion of all unique responses.
